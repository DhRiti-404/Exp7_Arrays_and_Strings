# Exp7_Arrays_and_Strings

This repository contains a set of C++ programs designed to help understand and practice key concepts related to **arrays** and **strings**. Each program includes a brief explanation of the theory, followed by practical implementation.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents & Detailed Theory

### 1. **Print Elements of an Array**
- **Theory**: Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same data type. They are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be accessed using indices.
- **Program Goal**: Declare an array, initialize it, and print each element using a loop.
- **Key Concepts**: Array declaration, indexing, `for` loop traversal.

---

### 2. **Input Elements & Access by Index**
- **Theory**: Arrays allow direct access to any element using its index. Indexing starts from 0.
- **Program Goal**: Take user input to fill an array and retrieve a specific element by its index.
- **Key Concepts**: `cin`, bounds checking, user interaction.

---

### 3. **Sum and Average of Array Elements**
- **Theory**: Summing elements involves iterating through the array and adding each value. Average is calculated by dividing the total sum by the number of elements.
- **Program Goal**: Accept array input, compute the sum, and calculate the average.
- **Key Concepts**: Looping, arithmetic operations, type casting for accurate average.

---

### 4. **Find Minimum and Maximum in Array**
- **Theory**: Finding the smallest or largest value requires comparing each element with a current minimum or maximum.
- **Program Goal**: Traverse the array to identify the minimum and maximum values.
- **Key Concepts**: Conditional logic, comparison operators, initialization with first element.

---

### 5. **String Declaration and Initialization**
- **Theory**: Strings in C++ can be handled using C-style character arrays or the `string` class from the Standard Library. The `string` class offers more flexibility and built-in functions.
- **Program Goal**: Demonstrate various ways to declare and initialize strings.
- **Key Concepts**: `char[]`, `string`, constructors, assignment, user input.

---

### 6. **String Concatenation**
- **Theory**: Concatenation means joining two or more strings into one. In C++, this can be done using the `+` operator or the `append()` method.
- **Program Goal**: Combine multiple strings and display the result.
- **Key Concepts**: `+`, `+=`, `append()`, memory handling.

---

### 7. **Print String in Reverse**
- **Theory**: Reversing a string involves accessing characters from the end to the beginning. This is useful in many algorithms like palindrome checking.
- **Program Goal**: Take a string input and print its reverse.
- **Key Concepts**: Looping in reverse, string indexing.

---

### 8. **Palindrome Check**
- **Theory**: A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. To check for a palindrome, compare characters from both ends moving toward the center.
- **Program Goal**: Clean the input (remove spaces, ignore case), then check if itâ€™s a palindrome.
- **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, `tolower()`, `isalnum()`, two-pointer technique.

## ðŸ“š Conclusion:
Through these experiments, we explored fundamental concepts of arrays and strings in C++. Arrays taught us how to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently, while string operations introduced us to textual data handling using both C-style and modern C++ approaches. By implementing tasks like searching, summing, reversing, and checking for palindromes, we gained practical experience in using loops, conditionals, and built-in functions.
